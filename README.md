The study presented in this paper was designed to investigate human preferences in one-sided drone-to-human communication in the specific context of a rescue operation. To this end, a virtual reality simulation was devised using the Unity framework. In the final study, each of the 21 participants was asked to navigate the virtually created flooding scenario using a VR headset and one hand-held controller. In the simulation, each participant would encounter a drone that would deliver one of three randomly assigned, pre-written monologues before initiating the rescue operation. Participants would then try and escape the dangerous situation in the simulation by following the drone. Having completed the simulation, participants were asked to answer a digital questionnaire comprised of three parts with a total of 10 questions surveying emotional aspects like trust and stress level. Statistical analysis revealed no significant effect of monologue length or level of informativeness.

Side note: Unfortunately, in this version, using VR headset and controller only works correctly when Input Manager is switched off and references to PlayerMovementScript and MouseLook are removed. Therefore, using the keyboard is recommended for playing the experiment in this version.
The other version with only VR gadget could not be uploaded to github due to commit data limit.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62394917/157554002-1edd699c-f210-40ed-ad07-9998c5d4e990.png)
